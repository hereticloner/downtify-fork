# Playlist cover art

Downtify can save a playlist's own cover next to its [M3U file](m3u-export.md), so media servers and file browsers show the real artwork for the playlist instead of a generic icon.

On by default. Turn it off in **Settings → Downloads & files → Save playlist cover art**.

## Where the file goes

The cover is written with the **same name and in the same folder as the playlist's M3U**, with a `.jpg` extension instead:

```
<downloads>/<playlist-name>/<playlist-name>.m3u
<downloads>/<playlist-name>/<playlist-name>.jpg
```

With *Organize by artist* or *Organize by album* on, tracks are spread across artist folders and the M3U goes to a central `Playlists/` directory (see [File organization](file-organization.md)) — the cover follows it:

```
<downloads>/Playlists/<playlist-name>.m3u
<downloads>/Playlists/<playlist-name>.jpg
```

::: info It needs the M3U
With **Write M3U playlists** off, no cover is saved either: Downtify places the image by the M3U's path, so without one there is nowhere to put it. The setting is hidden while M3U writing is off.

## Sources and resolution

| Source | Resolution |
|--------|-----------|
| **Spotify** | The largest image its public embed page offers for the playlist — the same one already used for the tracks' cover art |
| **YouTube Music** | Always requested at 1200×1200, independently of [Cover art resolution](download-settings.md#cover-art-resolution), which only affects per-track covers |

Both services serve JPEG for these URLs even when the original artwork was a PNG, so the file is always saved as `.jpg`.

## When it downloads

**Before the tracks**, in both cases — the folder already looks like the playlist while it fills up, and a media server that scans mid-download finds the artwork rather than a bare folder:

- **A manual playlist download** — once, as soon as the playlist name is resolved, before the first track starts.
- **[Playlist Monitor](playlist-monitor.md)** — once per sweep that has something to download, before that sweep's first track. A sweep that finds nothing new doesn't re-fetch it.

Failing to resolve or download the cover (a network error, a playlist with no artwork) is logged and skipped — it never holds up or fails the download itself.

## In the Downtify interface

A playlist that has its own artwork (downloaded with a Spotify or YouTube playlist) shows it everywhere the Library lists playlists — the grid, the playlist page, the sidebar and the player. Playlists without one, and playlists you create in the Library, show a mosaic of up to four distinct track covers: two side by side, three as a tall left tile plus two stacked on the right, four as a 2×2 grid. The same collage is written as `<playlist-name>.jpg` beside a manual playlist's M3U so Navidrome sees it too, and it is rebuilt whenever you add or remove songs.

## Navidrome

Nothing to configure: Navidrome resolves playlist artwork from a **sidecar image** — a file named after the playlist, in the same folder — which is exactly what Downtify writes. As long as Navidrome's music folder covers your downloads folder, the artwork appears on its next scan. No API call from Downtify is involved. See [Navidrome](slskd-navidrome.md#navidrome).

## Cleanup

Deleting a playlist from the Library page removes its cover along with its M3U and tracks — see [Deleting a playlist](slskd-navidrome.md#deleting-a-playlist).
