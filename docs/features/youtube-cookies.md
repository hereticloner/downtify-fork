# YouTube Cookies

Downtify pulls its audio from YouTube. Most of the time that works anonymously — but not always:

- **Explicit / age-restricted tracks.** YouTube only serves these to a signed-in adult account. Without cookies the download fails.
- **Bot challenges.** On datacenter IPs (VPS, some VPNs) YouTube periodically answers with "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" instead of audio.

Supplying a `cookies.txt` fixes both: yt-dlp then talks to YouTube as your logged-in browser session does.

## Uploading a cookies.txt (recommended)

1. Install a cookie-export extension: [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc) (Chrome/Edge) or [cookies.txt](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/) (Firefox)
2. Open `youtube.com` **logged into your Google account** and export the cookies for that site — the file must be in **Netscape** format
3. In Downtify, open **Settings** (⚙️) → **YouTube cookies** → **Upload cookies.txt**

The file is validated on upload — a file that isn't a Netscape cookie jar is rejected immediately rather than silently breaking every later download. If it contains no `youtube.com` or `google.com` cookies you get a warning, since that usually means it was exported from the wrong tab.

Once uploaded you can **replace** it (upload another file) or **delete** it from the same screen.

::: tip This is the platform-agnostic route
Uploading through the web UI needs no bind mounts, no file paths and no shell — which is what makes it work on Docker Desktop for Windows, where mounting a `cookies.txt` into the container is notoriously awkward.
:::

## Where it's stored

The uploaded file is written to `cookies.txt` inside Downtify's data directory (`/data` by default) — the same volume that holds `settings.json` and the Playlist Monitor database. It therefore **survives container updates**: pulling a new image and recreating the container keeps your cookies, as long as `/data` stays a named volume or bind mount.

## Using an environment variable instead

The pre-existing [`DOWNTIFY_COOKIES_FILE`](../getting-started/environment-variables.md#anti-bot-youtube) variable still works and **takes precedence**:

```yaml
services:
  downtify:
    volumes:
      - ./cookies.txt:/cookies.txt:ro
    environment:
      - DOWNTIFY_COOKIES_FILE=/cookies.txt
```

When it is set, the settings screen shows the cookie section as locked and refuses uploads and deletions — the deployment owns that configuration, and Downtify must not overwrite a file it doesn't manage. Unset the variable (and recreate the container) to manage cookies from the web UI instead.

`DOWNTIFY_COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER` reads cookies straight out of a browser profile, but that requires the browser's cookie store to be reachable *inside* the container, so it's rarely usable in Docker.

## Player clients and PO tokens

Cookies are the usual fix for the "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" wall, but two more knobs in **Settings → YouTube reliability** let you tune *how* yt-dlp talks to YouTube when cookies aren't enough — or when you can't use an account at all. They're the same escape hatches as the [`DOWNTIFY_YT_PLAYER_CLIENTS` and `DOWNTIFY_YT_PO_TOKEN`](../getting-started/environment-variables.md#anti-bot-youtube) variables, now editable from the web UI:

| Setting | What it is |
|---------|------------|
| **Player clients** | A comma-separated, ordered list of YouTube *player clients* (e.g. `tv, mweb`) that yt-dlp tries one after another. Different clients are gated differently, so trying another one is often what gets around a bot check — that's why the built-in default already favours clients that need no JavaScript runtime. |
| **PO tokens** | A comma-separated list of Proof-of-Origin tokens, each written as `<client>.<context>+<token>` (e.g. `mweb.gvs+abc123`). Only needed if YouTube starts demanding a PO token for the client you're using. |

How the values behave:

- **An empty box falls back**, first to the matching environment variable and then to Downtify's built-in default (for player clients, `ios, android, web_embedded, mweb, web, tv`; for PO tokens, none).
- **Order matters** for player clients: yt-dlp tries them in the order written. Saved settings take effect immediately, without a restart, and the server trims blank entries.
- The list is only a *hint* to yt-dlp — it can't make a blocked client work, so change one thing at a time and check a download before changing the next.

::: warning Change these only when you need to
The built-in list is already tuned so that a normal Docker host works without a JavaScript runtime. Override it when you know a specific client is being blocked, not pre-emptively — a wrong list can leave you with no working client at all.
:::

## Keeping them working

- Cookies expire. If age-restricted downloads start failing again, export a fresh file and upload it as a replacement.
- Exporting from a **private/incognito window** that you then close produces a longer-lived session, because closing a normal window can invalidate the exported session.
- Some regions require full identity verification on the Google account before YouTube serves age-restricted content at all. Being signed in is not always enough.

::: warning Treat the file like a password
A `cookies.txt` contains live session tokens for your Google account. Anyone who can read it can act as you on YouTube. Downtify stores it with owner-only permissions where the filesystem supports it, and never exposes its contents through the API — only whether one is configured, its size and when it changed. Use a throwaway Google account if you'd rather not risk your main one.
