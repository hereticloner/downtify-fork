# Features

Downtify covers everything you need to build and maintain a local music library from Spotify.

## Overview

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| [Charts](charts.md) | Browse Deezer's global chart and download whatever is trending |
| [Finder](finder.md) | Search Deezer, then browse an artist, their albums and any album's tracks in columns |
| [Download Settings](download-settings.md) | Choose format (MP3/FLAC/M4A/OGG/OPUS), bitrate, parallel downloads and delay between downloads |
| [Queue](queue.md) | Pause and resume the whole download queue from the Queue page |
| [Playlist Monitor](playlist-monitor.md) | Watch Spotify or YouTube Music playlists and artists, and auto-download new tracks and releases |
| [Top Songs](top-songs.md) | Paste an artist link and download their most popular songs, optionally as a playlist |
| [Library Import (CSV)](library-import.md) | Import a library export from Soundiiz, TuneMyMusic or Exportify and queue the whole thing |
| [Built-in Player](player.md) | Play your library in the browser: queue management, synced lyrics, sleep timer, keyboard and media keys |
| [Liked songs](liked-songs.md) | Heart a song to like it; a playlist of everything you have liked appears on its own |
| [Podcasts](podcasts.md) | Subscribe to a show by RSS feed, Spotify link or name; new episodes download and tag on their own |
| [Users & Sign-in](users.md) | Username and password sign-in (`admin` / `downtify` on a new server), admin and normal user accounts, per-user preferences, and an activity log of sign-ins and what everyone plays |
| [Replace Audio](replace-audio.md) | Wrong song or version? Pick the right one on YouTube Music or YouTube; the file keeps its name, tags and playlists |
| [Server Settings](server.md) | The port Downtify listens on, changed from Settings (admins), with a restart right away if you like |
| [Mobile Apps](mobile-apps.md) | Pair phone apps by QR code and stream the library to them (original or transcoded) |
| [Discover](discover.md) | Artists, albums and playlists you don't have yet, suggested from your library, likes and listening; hide the ones you don't want |
| [Navidrome](slskd-navidrome.md) | Mirror the playlists you download into Navidrome, and track playlist downloads |
| [Library catalog & path sync](library-catalog.md) | How Downtify tracks library files and playlists, playlists you create in the Library, and fixing paths after moving files |
| [Collections](collections.md) | Group your library playlists into named collections, one level above the playlist |
| [Stats](stats.md) | Library, download and play counts, a downloads-per-day chart and your most-played tracks |
| [Notifications](notifications.md) | A Telegram message when a watch downloads new tracks |
| [Scrobbling](scrobbling.md) | Send plays to last.fm |

| [Storage](storage.md) | Disk usage and a duplicate-song cleanup with one kept copy |
