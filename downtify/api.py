"""FastAPI router exposed by Downtify.

The endpoints intentionally mirror the surface that the previous
``spotdl``-powered backend exposed so the existing Vue frontend keeps
working without changes:

* ``GET  /api/version``
* ``GET  /api/health`` (liveness probe for the Docker ``HEALTHCHECK`` -
  see ``healthcheck.sh``; always ``200`` once the server can answer
  requests, regardless of downloader/monitor readiness)
* ``GET  /api/songs/search``
* ``GET  /api/artists/search``
* ``GET  /api/discover/chart`` (Deezer's own global "what's trending"
  chart - no auth, no genre filter - as ``{tracks, albums, artists,
  playlists}``; tracks are shaped like ``/api/songs/search``
  (``source: 'deezer'``, plus ``preview_url`` when Deezer offers a 30s
  clip) and downloadable the same way; albums/artists/playlists are
  read-only summaries - Downtify has no Deezer discography resolver,
  so their ``url`` only opens on Deezer, unlike a YouTube Music/Spotify
  result)
* ``GET  /api/finder/search`` (the Finder page's Deezer-only free-text
  search: ``{songs, albums, artists}``; songs shaped like the chart's
  tracks plus ``deezer_artist_id``/``deezer_album_id``, albums/artists
  as summaries with Deezer ids, fans and track/album counts)
* ``GET  /api/finder/artist`` (``artist_id``, ``lang``: a Deezer
  artist's photo, fans, album count, plain-text ``bio``, ``social``
  links, ``related`` artists and ``top_songs``)
* ``GET  /api/finder/artist/songs`` (``artist_id``, ``name``: the
  artist's songs as a Finder search's ``{songs, albums, artists}`` - a
  name search kept to rows by that Deezer id; albums/artists empty)
* ``GET  /api/finder/artist/albums`` (``artist_id``: their whole
  discography, most recent first; ``track_count`` is ``null`` until
  known)
* ``GET  /api/finder/albums/track_counts`` (``ids``, comma-separated, 50
  at most: ``{album_id: track_count}`` for the ones Deezer answered -
  throttled under Deezer's request quota)
* ``GET  /api/finder/album`` (``album_id``: label, genres, UPC, length,
  fans, contributors and ``tracks``, downloadable song rows)
* ``GET  /api/artists/top_songs`` (an artist's "Top songs" shelf preview,
  same shape as ``/api/songs/search`` - no further pagination offered)
* ``GET  /api/artists/top_albums`` (an artist's 5 most popular albums,
  sorted by YouTube Music's own "Popularity" order; same shape as
  ``/api/albums/search``; for every album/single, use ``/api/url`` on
  the artist's channel URL instead)
* ``GET  /api/artists/info`` (an artist's own profile: name, thumbnail,
  bio - not their releases)
* ``GET  /api/artists/similar`` (an artist's "Fans might also like"
  shelf, same shape as ``/api/artists/search``)
* ``GET  /api/artists/art`` (``{photo_url, banner_url, photo_version,
  banner_version}`` - the version, the file's modified time in ms, goes in
  the URL as ``?v=`` so a replaced image isn't served from a browser
  cache - whichever of an
  artist's saved photo/banner sidecar files exist under
  ``/downloads/.metadata/...``)
* ``GET  /api/artists/photo-proxy`` (DISPLAY-ONLY photo of an artist
  that has no saved one - a related artist, or a Library artist (in the
  grid and on its own page) nobody picked a photo for - relayed from
  Deezer and never stored - see
  ``downtify.artist_photo_proxy``; browser-cached for three hours - a
  photo, or Deezer having none (404) - but a photo already saved locally
  is served uncached instead, and a failure is a 503 that is never cached;
  ``?url=``, optional, is the artist's Deezer picture when the page
  already has it - Discover, the Finder - base64url-encoded, relayed
  without a search by name)
* ``POST /api/artists/art/bulk`` (the same, for many artists at once -
  body ``{names}``, response ``{<name>: {photo_url, banner_url,
  photo_version, banner_version}}`` - used
  by the Library page's artist grid)
* ``GET  /api/artists/art/search`` (free-text artist photo candidates from
  YouTube Music + Deezer, each ``{source, name, image_url}``)
* ``GET  /api/artists/art/spotify_candidate`` (a Spotify photo or banner
  candidate - ``kind`` query param - resolved from one already-downloaded
  track's Spotify id when ``file`` gives one (see
  ``downtify.track_index``), else from an exact-name search on the
  optional ``name`` param)
* ``POST /api/artists/art/from_url`` (fetch and save a chosen candidate or
  a pasted image link as an artist's photo or banner)
* ``POST /api/artists/art/upload`` (save an uploaded photo/banner - the
  raw image bytes as the request body, like ``POST /api/cookies``)
* ``DELETE /api/artists/art`` (remove a saved photo or banner)
* ``GET  /api/artists/profile`` (an artist's saved profile JSON: bio,
  origin, formation year, group flag, banner colour, social links,
  related artists, platform ids, which source their current photo/
  banner came from - a blank skeleton if nothing was saved yet; never
  seeds one, see ``POST .../ensure`` below for that)
* ``GET  /api/artists/top_songs/spotify`` (the artist's first five Spotify
  top songs, same shape as ``/api/artists/top_songs/url`` plus
  ``fetched_at``/``stale`` - read from ``.metadata/ArtistTopSongs/`` while
  fresh (7 days), fetched and saved when missing, refreshed in the
  background when stale; needs ``platforms_id.spotify`` in the profile)
* ``POST /api/artists/profile/ensure`` (seed a brand-new artist's
  profile the first time it's needed - Spotify/YouTube Music photo and
  banner (each only when its ``download_cover_art_artist``/``..._banner``
  setting is on), then everything ``.../bio`` below would fetch - a no-op
  once a profile file exists at all, even an empty one; body
  ``{name, lang, track_files}``)
* ``POST /api/artists/profile/bio`` (fetch bio and save it - Apple Music
  primary (also brings origin/formation year/genre/group flag/banner
  colour), Deezer secondary (bio fallback + social links + related artists) -
  body ``{name, lang, source?}`` (``source`` = ``applemusic`` or ``deezer``
  to save only that service's bio, no fallback; default: both, in that
  order); resolves and caches the artist's Apple Music/Deezer ids on first
  use)
* ``POST /api/artists/profile/bio/preview`` (one service's bio text only -
  body ``{name, lang, source}``, ``source`` = ``applemusic`` or ``deezer``;
  response ``{bio}``; saves nothing, the edit modal loads it into its text
  box and the user keeps it with ``PUT .../bio``)
* ``DELETE /api/artists/profile/bio`` (clear only the saved bio text -
  everything else is kept)
* ``PUT  /api/artists/profile/bio`` (manually set the bio text directly -
  body ``{name, bio}``; the user's own text, never fetched)
* ``PUT  /api/artists/profile/social`` (manually set all five social
  links directly - body ``{name, social: {twitter, facebook, website,
  instagram, youtube}}``; replaces the whole object, never fetched)
* ``GET  /api/song/url`` and ``GET /api/url`` (alias; ``/api/url`` also
  resolves an artist channel/``@handle`` (YouTube Music) or artist link
  (Deezer) URL into every one of their albums/singles as lightweight
  summaries, same shape as ``/api/albums/search`` - no tracklists;
  resolve a chosen release's tracks separately). A YouTube Music or
  Deezer playlist URL resolves to its tracks, like a Spotify playlist.
  Accepts a Spotify, YouTube Music or Deezer track/album/playlist URL
  (plus a YouTube Music/Deezer artist URL, as above).
* ``GET  /api/url/resolve`` (the same links, always as
  ``{kind, name, subtitle, cover_url, year, tracks, albums}`` - adds the
  playlist/album name and cover the plain track list lacks; a Deezer
  track's own ``preview_url`` survives into its song row, same as
  ``/api/discover/chart``)
* ``GET  /api/artists/top_songs/url`` (a Spotify, YouTube Music or Deezer
  artist URL - ``open.spotify.com/artist/...``, ``/channel/UC...``,
  ``/@handle`` or ``deezer.com/artist/...`` - resolved to ``{source,
  artist_id, name, cover_url, songs}``: the artist's own "Popular" /
  "Top songs" / "top" shelf, in the order the source ranks it)
* ``POST /api/download/url`` (optional JSON body: resolved Spotify row so
  ``track_number`` / ``album_track_total`` survive re-fetch by URL; a
  ``"source": "deezer"`` body is taken as-is instead, see
  ``_song_from_download_request``)
* ``POST /api/download/batch`` (JSON body ``{songs, playlist_url,
  generate_m3u}``; instead of ``playlist_url`` a caller may pass an
  explicit ``playlist_name`` and ``cover_url`` - e.g. an artist's top
  songs selection, which isn't backed by a real playlist id; a Deezer
  ``playlist_url`` gets the same per-playlist folder, M3U and cover as a
  Spotify/YouTube Music one, but isn't tracked as a resumable batch)
* ``POST /api/download/album`` (YouTube Music album/browse URL only;
  downloads every track from one shared, already-resolved tracklist so
  metadata stays consistent across the whole release)
* ``POST /api/download/csv`` (import a library-export CSV from Soundiiz,
  TuneMyMusic, Exportify, etc.; JSON body ``{csv, playlist_name,
  generate_m3u}`` - the raw CSV text, read client-side, not a multipart
  upload)
* ``POST /api/playlist/m3u``
* ``GET  /api/queue``, ``DELETE /api/queue``, ``DELETE /api/queue/item``
  and ``DELETE /api/queue/completed`` (drop finished jobs only)
* ``POST /api/queue/pause`` and ``POST /api/queue/resume`` (stop starting
  new downloads; in-flight rows finish - resume unblocks the queue)
* ``DELETE /api/library/playlist`` (delete a downloaded playlist's
  tracks, M3U and catalog entry; a manual playlist only loses the M3U)
* ``GET  /api/library/summary`` (Home page: counts + recent albums)
* ``GET  /api/library/albums`` (Library albums tab: albums without tracks)
* ``GET  /api/library/artists`` (Library artists tab / Discover)
* ``POST /api/library/lookup`` (search/link songs already in the library)
* ``POST /api/library/playlists`` (create an empty editable playlist)
* ``POST /api/library/playlists/tracks`` (add or remove tracks on a
  manual playlist)
* ``POST /api/library/playlists/rename`` (rename a manual playlist)
* ``POST /api/library/reconcile`` (fix stored library paths after files
  moved on disk, then refresh M3U/Navidrome playlists)
* ``POST /api/library/external/sync`` (start a background scan of
  extra folders) and ``GET /api/library/external/sync`` (running or
  last-finished status)
* ``POST /api/library/external/unmap`` (drop one extra folder from
  the library without deleting the audio files)
* ``GET  /api/library/replace/candidates`` (versions of a library track
  to pick from: YouTube Music and YouTube results, or a pasted link) and
  ``POST /api/library/replace`` (body ``{file, video_id}``: replace the
  track's audio with that video in place, as a queue job - see
  ``downtify/audio_replace.py``)
* ``GET  /api/library/upgrade`` and ``GET /api/library/upgrade/jobs``
  (an upgrade run's state, queue counts and per-track rows)
* ``POST /api/library/upgrade/scan`` (look for tracks with low-resolution
  artwork, no lyrics or incomplete tags; writes nothing),
  ``POST /api/library/upgrade/start`` (body ``{categories}``) and
  ``POST /api/library/upgrade/{pause,resume,cancel}``
* ``GET  /api/playlists/batches`` and
  ``GET|DELETE /api/playlists/batches/{spotify_playlist_id}`` (Spotify
  playlist downloads and their completeness against Spotify)
* ``GET  /api/playlists/incomplete`` and
  ``POST /api/playlists/incomplete/download-missing`` (queue only the
  tracks a downloaded playlist is still missing)
* ``GET  /api/settings``
* ``POST /api/settings/update``
* ``GET  /api/fs/dirs`` (admin: directory-name suggestions for path
  fields, ``?path=``)
* ``POST /api/navidrome/test`` (try the connection with the settings as
  they are in the form, saved or not)
* ``POST /api/notifications/test`` (send a Telegram test notification
  with the settings as they are in the form, saved or not)
* ``POST /api/scrobbling/test`` and the
  ``POST /api/scrobbling/lastfm/auth/{start,finish}`` pair (check the
  last.fm session and connect the account without saving)
* ``GET /api/storage/report``, ``GET /api/storage/duplicates`` and
  ``POST /api/storage/duplicates/delete`` (disk usage, duplicate songs
  and their cleanup)
* ``GET  /api/cookies`` (current YouTube cookie configuration)
* ``POST /api/cookies`` (upload a Netscape cookies.txt as the raw request
  body - no multipart, so no ``python-multipart`` dependency)
* ``DELETE /api/cookies`` (remove the uploaded cookies.txt)
* ``GET|POST /api/monitor/playlists`` and
  ``PATCH|DELETE /api/monitor/playlists/{playlist_id}`` (playlist and
  artist watches; ``PATCH`` takes ``interval_minutes``, ``enabled`` and
  ``url`` - a link to a different playlist/artist of the same kind
  retargets the watch; artist watches also take ``release_types``
  (``album``/``single``/``ep``) and ``new_only``, on ``POST`` too),
  ``POST /api/monitor/playlists/{id}/check``
* ``GET|PUT /api/likes`` and ``POST /api/likes/clear`` (the heart on a
  library track; while any song is liked they are also written out as a
  playlist)
* ``POST /api/podcasts/resolve`` (preview a podcast from a pasted RSS
  or Spotify show/episode link) and ``GET /api/podcasts/search``
  (free-text, via the iTunes podcast directory)
* ``POST /api/podcasts/subscribe``, ``GET /api/podcasts/shows``,
  ``GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/podcasts/shows/{id}`` and
  ``GET /api/podcasts/shows/{id}/episodes`` (subscriptions are a watch
  kind in ``monitor.py``, checked on the same schedule as playlists and
  artists — see ``downtify.podcasts``)
* ``POST /api/podcasts/episodes/{id}/download``,
  ``DELETE /api/podcasts/episodes/{id}`` and
  ``PUT /api/podcasts/episodes/{id}/playback`` (per-episode download,
  removal and resume position)
* ``POST /api/discover`` (suggested artists the library doesn't have
  yet - body ``{library: [{name, tracks, liked}]}``, the Library page's
  own artist grouping; response ``{artists: [{name, deezer_id,
  picture_url, fans, score, because}], seeds, partial}`` - see
  ``downtify.discover``), ``POST /api/discover/collections`` (albums and
  playlists built on those artists - same body plus ``albums: [{artist,
  title}]`` and ``playlist_ids``; response ``{albums, more_albums,
  playlists, artist_urls, partial}``; Spotify only), ``POST
  /api/discover/collections/deezer`` (the same shelves from Deezer
  alone, the web page's first answer - body adds ``playlist_names``;
  every item carries ``source: 'deezer'`` and Deezer ids, albums also
  ``key``, playlists are Deezer's "100% <artist>"), ``POST
  /api/discover/collections/spotify`` (what Spotify adds, the second
  answer - body adds ``shown``, the album ``key``\\ s already on the page;
  albums matched to Deezer by name come with ``source: 'deezer'``, the
  rest ``'spotify'``; playlists are only Spotify's "This Is <artist>"),
  ``POST|DELETE
  /api/discover/listens`` (count
  one listen to an artist - body ``{artist}`` - or forget them all) and
  ``GET|POST|DELETE /api/discover/blocked`` (artists never to suggest -
  ``POST`` body ``{name}``, ``DELETE`` takes ``?name=``)
* ``GET  /api/preview`` (a song's 30 s preview clip from Deezer, for a
  song with no ``preview_url`` of its own - ``?artist=&title=&duration=``,
  response ``{preview_url}``, ``""`` when Deezer has no matching song)
* ``GET  /api/server/info`` (public: server id, name, version,
  ``api_version``, ``require_sign_in`` (always true), capabilities) and
  ``PATCH /api/server`` (``{name}``) - see ``downtify/auth_routes.py``
* ``GET  /api/auth/status``, ``POST /api/auth/login`` (``{username,
  password}``), ``POST /api/auth/logout`` (signing in), ``GET|PATCH|DELETE
  /api/auth/devices[/{id}]`` (your paired apps; everyone's for an admin),
  ``POST /api/auth/revoke-all`` (everyone signed out), ``POST
  /api/auth/pairing``, ``GET|DELETE /api/auth/pairing/{id}``, ``POST
  /api/auth/pair`` (pairing an app) and ``POST /api/auth/ws-ticket`` -
  see ``downtify/auth.py`` for who may call what
* ``GET|PATCH /api/me``, ``PUT /api/me/password``, ``GET|PUT
  /api/me/preferences``, ``POST /api/me/sign-out-everywhere`` (your
  account), ``GET|POST /api/users``, ``PATCH|DELETE /api/users/{id}``
  (admins), ``GET /api/activity``, ``GET /api/activity/now`` (admins) and
  ``POST /api/activity/playback`` (players report what they play) - see
  ``downtify/account_routes.py``
* ``/api/v1/...``: the apps' API, by track id - ``GET /api/v1/library``
  (``?since=`` change feed), ``GET /api/v1/tracks/{id}`` (and
  ``/stream``, ``/cover``, ``/lyrics``), ``GET /api/v1/playlists``,
  ``GET|PUT /api/v1/likes`` and ``POST /api/v1/sign`` - see
  ``downtify/mobile_routes.py`` and ``docs/mobile-client-contract.md``
* ``WS   /api/ws`` (also ``library_changed``, ``device_paired``
  messages; a device token, session cookie or ``?ticket=`` is needed)
* ``GET  /api/check_update``
