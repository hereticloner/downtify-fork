## What Downtify is

Self-hosted Spotify downloader. Resolves track/album/playlist metadata from the public `open.spotify.com/embed` endpoints (no Spotify Premium / Web API key needed), then pulls audio from YouTube via `yt-dlp`, transcodes with `ffmpeg`, and embeds cover art + ID3/Vorbis/MP4 metadata via `mutagen`. Ships a FastAPI backend + Vue 3 SPA, distributed as a Docker image.

Entry point: `main.py` (CLI flag `web` boots the FastAPI app on `DOWNTIFY_PORT`, default `8000`).

## Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.10–3.13 (Docker image pins 3.13), FastAPI, Uvicorn, `loguru`, `yt-dlp`, `mutagen`, `requests`, `ytmusicapi`.
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + Vue Router, Tailwind CSS v4 (design tokens in `frontend/src/styles/tokens.css`, shared with the docs site), VueUse, Vite, Vitest.
- **Packaging**: `uv` (lockfile is `uv.lock`; `requirements.txt` is exported for Docker only — do **not** hand-edit).
- **Container**: Alpine + `ffmpeg` + `tini` + `su-exec` (UID/GID/UMASK env-controlled).
- **CI**: GitHub Actions (`build.yml`, `test.yml`, `docs.yml`, `codeflash.yaml`).
- **Docs**: VitePress with a custom Tailwind theme, its own npm package in `docs/` (`make doc`, `make doc-build`).

## Layout

```

## Development workflow

```bash
make run        # uv run python main.py web   (dev backend on :8000)
make test       # frontend + docs Vitest, then pytest -x -s -v
make format     # ruff format + ruff --fix + prettier (frontend/src, docs/.vitepress)
make lint       # ruff check + prettier --check
make export     # regenerate requirements.txt from uv.lock (Docker build input)
make up / down  # docker compose
make doc        # docs dev server (VitePress, hot reload)
make doc-build  # production docs build into docs/.vitepress/dist
```

Frontend dev: `npm --prefix frontend run dev` (Vite). The backend serves `frontend/dist` in production; during dev the SPA proxies API calls.

Version bump: `make version 2.7.1` — runs `version.sh`, rebuilds the frontend, formats. Keep `pyproject.toml`, `downtify/__init__.py`, `frontend/package.json`, `Makefile`, and `Dockerfile` labels in sync (the script handles this).

## Coding standards

- Ruff is the single source of truth. `line-length = 79`, single quotes, `preview = true`, rules `I, F, E, W, PL, PT`. Per-file ignores already exist for `main.py`, `downloader.py`, `downtify/*.py`, and `tests/*.py` — **don't widen them**, fix the code instead.
- Type hints required on public functions and any new code. Use `from __future__ import annotations` (existing convention).
- Logging: use `loguru` (`from loguru import logger`). Stdlib `logging` is intercepted in `main.py:_InterceptHandler` — do not reconfigure it.
- Keep the existing API surface stable. The Vue frontend depends on the exact endpoint shapes documented in `downtify/api.py`'s module docstring. Add new endpoints rather than renaming.
- No new top-level dependencies without a clear need — `yt-dlp`, `mutagen`, `ytmusicapi`, `fastapi`, `loguru` cover the vast majority of cases.

## Domain gotchas (do not rediscover these)

- **Spotify embed schema**: playlist tracks expose `subtitle` (joined artist string), **not** an `artists` list, and have **no per-track cover** — fall back to the playlist cover. See `downtify/spotify.py`.
- **Playlist size cap**: the embed endpoint caps at ~50–100 tracks. Full playlists require the anonymous token + `api.spotify.com` pagination path already implemented in `spotify.py`. Don't replace it with the embed-only path.
- **yt-dlp anti-bot**: defaults use `player_client=tv,mweb` plus cookies / IPv4 env knobs. If YouTube returns "Sign in to confirm" errors, tune these in `downloader.py` rather than switching extractors.
- **Lyrics**: `lrclib` and `netease` are wired end-to-end and tried in the user's order (`lyrics_providers`), with per-song misses cached in `downtify/lyrics_cache.py`. `genius` / `musixmatch` / `azlyrics` are accepted in saved settings but never fetch anything (AZLyrics forbids third-party use, Musixmatch needs credentials, Genius' robots.txt disallows its search endpoint) — do not claim they work in docs.
- **Library upgrade**: `downtify/library_upgrade.py` scans the library and repairs artwork / lyrics / tags in place. It rewrites a verified working copy (`<name>.downtify-upgrade.<ext>`, skipped by the library scan via `library_catalog.UPGRADE_STAGING_MARKER`) and keeps the original mtime. Audio is deliberately never replaced by an upgrade — replacing it is `downtify/audio_replace.py` (the admin picks the version by hand; same path, same format, tags copied over). Don't add automatic replacement without the match-confidence and playlist-rename work the issue describes. Cover sizes come from `downtify/image_size.py` (header parsing, no Pillow) and are cached per file in `library_metadata_cache` (`cover_px`; bump `META_VERSION` when tag-derived columns change, and add the column to **both** the `CREATE TABLE` and `_ADDED_COLUMNS`).
- **Tag embedding**: cover art and lyrics must round-trip across MP3 (ID3 APIC/USLT), FLAC (Picture/Vorbis), M4A (`covr`/`©lyr`), Opus/Vorbis. The cover-extraction code in `main.py:_extract_cover` is the canonical reader — mirror its container handling when adding new formats.

## Testing

- Python: `uv run pytest -x -s -v`. Tests live in `tests/` and avoid network where possible — keep new tests offline (fixtures / monkeypatched HTTP).
- Frontend: `npm --prefix frontend test` (Vitest).
- For changes touching `spotify.py`, `providers.py`, `downloader.py`, or `m3u.py`, add or extend the matching `tests/test_*.py`. The `test_spotify_embed.py` / `test_spotify_url.py` suites already cover the embed schema quirks — extend them rather than mocking around them.
- `codeflash` (CI) optimizes hot paths. Don't write code that depends on micro-optimizations Codeflash might rewrite; keep functions pure and small so its rewrites stay safe.

## Documentation

There are two documentation surfaces, with different jobs — don't blur them:

- **`README.md`** — a short overview for someone landing on the GitHub repo for the first time: what Downtify is, quick start, a features table, and brief pointers. Keep sections to a few lines each. When a feature needs more than that (full option tables, edge cases, env var reference, API shapes), the README gets a one-paragraph summary plus a link into `docs/` — the detail itself belongs in `docs/`, not duplicated in both places.
- **`docs/`** (built by VitePress, served by GitHub Pages from the custom domain `downtify.henriquesebastiao.com`, at its root — the `henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/` URL only redirects there. See `SITE_URL` and `BASE` in `docs/.vitepress/config.mjs`; keep `BASE` at `/`, since a `/downtify/` prefix points every asset at a 404 and the site renders unstyled) — the complete reference. This is where full option tables, every environment variable, the full API reference (`docs/api-reference.md`), and per-feature deep-dives (`docs/features/*.md`) live. New user-facing features get a page here (add it to `NAV` in `docs/.vitepress/nav.mjs` too, and give it an `icon: lucide/<name>` front matter), not just a README blurb.

Docs site gotchas:

- Page URLs are directory-style (`features/player.md` → `/features/player/`) and heading ids follow Python-Markdown's rules (`GET /api/url/resolve` → `#get-apiurlresolve`, repeats get `_1`) — both kept from the old zensical site because README and issues link to them. Don't change `docs/.vitepress/lib/routes.mjs` or `slug.mjs` without checking existing links.
- Write Markdown links relative to the source file (`[Lyrics](../features/lyrics.md#x)`); the build rewrites them. Callouts use `::: info|tip|warning Title` … `:::`.
- The build fails on dead links **and** broken `#anchors`; run `make doc-build` after editing docs.
- Pages are Vue templates: a literal `{{` or an unknown `<Tag>` outside code breaks the build.

Cross-check both against the code, not against each other — a stale doc citing another stale doc just launders the error.

## Quality bar before declaring a task done

1. `make lint` clean (no new ruff or prettier diff).
2. `make test` green (both pytest and Vitest).
3. New code paths covered by a test, or a clear note in the PR why not.
4. No new permissive `extend-ignore` / per-file ignore entries.
5. If the change affects download behavior: manually run `make run`, pull one Spotify track + one playlist, confirm metadata, cover art, and (when enabled) lyrics embed correctly. State the manual verification explicitly — type checks do not validate this.
6. If the change affects the SPA: `npm --prefix frontend run build` succeeds and the resulting `frontend/dist` is served correctly by the backend.
7. Docker: if Python deps changed, run `make export` so `requirements.txt` matches `uv.lock` before merging — the Docker build uses `requirements.txt`, not `uv.lock`.
8. **Before calling any task finished**, check whether it changed user-facing behavior (new/changed setting, env var, endpoint, UI control, supported input type, language, limit). If it did, update `README.md` (brief overview + link) and the matching `docs/` page(s) in the same change — see [Documentation](#documentation). If nothing user-facing changed (internal refactor, test-only change, CI config), say so explicitly instead of silently skipping this.

## Things to never do

- Reintroduce `spotdl` / `spotipy` / Spotify Web API credentials. The project deliberately removed that dependency.
- Commit `frontend/dist`, `downloads/`, `data/`, or any `.mp3` / `.m4a` artefacts (`.gitignore` covers these — keep it that way).
- Bypass `ruff` / `prettier` with inline disables to silence a warning. Fix the cause.
- Change the public API endpoint paths or response shapes without simultaneously updating the Vue frontend.
- Add network calls to tests without a recorded fixture.
- Hand-edit `requirements.txt` — regenerate via `make export`.
- Skip hooks (`--no-verify`) on commits.

## Useful entry points when investigating

- Download lifecycle: `downtify/api.py` (`POST /api/download/url`) → `downtify/downloader.py:Downloader` → `downtify/providers.py` (search) → `mutagen` tag write → `downtify/lyrics.py`.
- Playlist sync: `downtify/monitor.py:monitor_loop` + `PlaylistMonitorDB` (sqlite under `/data`).
- WebSocket progress: `downtify/api.py:ConnectionManager` (`WS /api/ws`).
- Static SPA + cover serving: `main.py:build_app`, `main.py:SPAStaticFiles`, `main.py:_extract_cover`.
